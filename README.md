# About California’s traffic volume 
California’s traffic volume is substantial, with over 31 million registered vehicles traveling more than 32,000 million miles annually1. The state uses Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) to measure traffic, which is the total volume for the year divided by 365 days2. Traffic volumes are highest in urban areas, particularly during peak hours2. Caltrans provides detailed traffic counts for state highways, helping in planning and designing infrastructure2. Significant volume changes are tracked along routes to manage congestion and improve safety.

# OBJECTIVE

- Conduct an in-depth analysis of traffic patterns and trends in California.
- Assess the impact of traffic patterns on road safety and identify accident hotspots.
- Provide actionable insights for infrastructure planning and develop traffic management strategies.
- Assist policymakers in creating data-driven policies.
- Foster community engagement by sharing findings and encouraging public participation in traffic safety initiatives.


# Key Factors Influencing Traffic Patterns

- Year/Month: We’ll analyze traffic patterns across different dates to identify any significant trends or anomalies.
- Day/Time: Examining traffic flow by day and hour will help us understand peak and off-peak periods.
- Weather: We’ll consider the impact of holidays on traffic volume and congestion levels.
- Holidays: Assessing traffic conditions under various weather types will reveal how weather influences traffic behavior.


# Conclusion & Recommendations 
- The data can help in planning infrastructure improvements to accommodate peak traffic periods.
- Businesses can use this data to optimize delivery schedules and manage supply chains more effectively during high traffic months.
- Identifying peak traffic months can aid in planning events to either avoid congestion or capitalize on high traffic periods.
- The data can be used to improve road infrastructure and traffic signal timings to better manage peak traffic periods.
- Adjusting public transportation schedules to align with peak traffic times can enhance efficiency and reduce congestion.
- Businesses can optimize delivery and service schedules based on traffic patterns to ensure timely operations.
